         "story": "This blend comes from two neighbors in the mountains—different paths, same mission.\n\nFirst, there’s Bochica, Colombia.\nGrown high in Huila, Cauca, Nariño, and Tolima, it’s tended by small-scale farmers who still handpick ripe cherries one by one. They wash and rest the coffee for a day or so—26 to 36 quiet hours—before drying. It’s careful, patient work. The result is coffee with a gentle brightness and calm sweetness.\n\nThen, there’s ASDECAFE from Guatemala.\nA younger collective—more than 1,000 growers—spread across Huehuetenango and El Quiché. By joining forces, they share the cost of moving coffee down the mountain and up through certification. Together, they can earn more, learn more, and grow better.\n\nWe bring these two coffees together—Colombia’s steady, hands-on tradition and Guatemala’s shared strength—to land in a sweet, balanced cup.\n\nBright meets smooth.\nCommunity meets craft.\nTwo origins, one quiet moment in your mug.\n\nSip slow."

        "story": "In the Tarrazú mountains of Costa Rica, producer Bryan Rivera Ureña tends a small family farm—about four hectares—called Finca Santa Rosa. His Bourbon cherries are dried naturally with a light touch, letting the fruit lead.\n\nThe cup shows lush, structured fruit: dark berries, blackberry lemonade, orange zest, and a gentle hazelnut finish—lively as espresso and soft like a strawberry–plum milkshake with milk.\n\nCherry is cleaned and moved to greenhouse patios where slow, even airflow stretches drying to nearly a month. Once at ideal humidity, the coffee rests for at least six weeks to stabilize and deepen sweetness.\n\nOur roast approach stays steady and unhurried—less burner energy and extended drying/Maillard to unlock deeper fruit and caramel.\n\nBrew it a touch finer on a flat-bottom dripper with a moderate dose to catch the full expression.\n\nSip slow."
