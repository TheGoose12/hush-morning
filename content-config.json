         "story": "This blend comes from two neighbors in the mountains—different paths, same mission.\n\nFirst, there’s Bochica, Colombia.\nGrown high in Huila, Cauca, Nariño, and Tolima, it’s tended by small-scale farmers who still handpick ripe cherries one by one. They wash and rest the coffee for a day or so—26 to 36 quiet hours—before drying. It’s careful, patient work. The result is coffee with a gentle brightness and calm sweetness.\n\nThen, there’s ASDECAFE from Guatemala.\nA younger collective—more than 1,000 growers—spread across Huehuetenango and El Quiché. By joining forces, they share the cost of moving coffee down the mountain and up through certification. Together, they can earn more, learn more, and grow better.\n\nWe bring these two coffees together—Colombia’s steady, hands-on tradition and Guatemala’s shared strength—to land in a sweet, balanced cup.\n\nBright meets smooth.\nCommunity meets craft.\nTwo origins, one quiet moment in your mug.\n\nSip slow."

        "story": "This lot comes from smallholders in Chelchele, part of Ethiopia’s Gedeb district—an area revered for its explosive naturals and aromatic intensity. Gedeb borders Guji, and its profiles stretch beyond classic Yirgacheffe: expect high-elevation clarity, fruit-forward sparkle, and a perfume-like lift unique to this corner of Gedeo.\n\nThe coffee was processed by EDN Ethiopian Coffee at their Chelchele site, where more than 200 seasonal workers rotate cherry, sort meticulously, and manage the long natural-drying cycle. EDN prefinances farmers and supports staff with meals, lodging, and education—an approach that builds loyalty and stability in a highly competitive region.\n\nFor this microlot, ripe cherry is sorted, floated, and sealed in carbon-fiber drums for 7–10 days of cool anaerobic fermentation. The slow, oxygen-free environment deepens fruit sugars without tipping into over-fermentation. Post-ferment, the syrupy cherry mass dries gradually on raised beds before resting in cool storage to stabilize sweetness and extend longevity.\n\nThe result is a vibrant, fruit-saturated cup with berry perfume, candy-like acidity, and a soft, syrupy finish.\n\nBrew a touch finer to catch the full glow.\n\nSip slow."
